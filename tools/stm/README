This directory contains STMicroelectronics build specific scripts.

Usage:
- build.sh : builds the v8 library, the sample shell and the cctests.
  usage: build.sh
  example: env arch=sh4 site=stgnb ./build.sh # builds for sh4 on STM GNB site.

- run_cctest.sh : runs the cctest tests with an optional argument for filtering the tests to run.
  usage: run_cctest.sh [test_regexp]
  example: env arch=sh4 site=stgnb ./run_cctest.sh sh4 # runs the sh4 regression tests on STM GNB site.

- source_site_<site>.sh : for each site a preconfiguration file loaded by build/run scripts.
  example: source_site_default.sh # the default configuration for a standard Linux distribution
  example: source_site_stgnb.sh # the configuration for the STM GNB site

- source_<arch>.sh : for each architecture the preconfiguration script used by build/run scripts.
  example: source_sh4.sh # the default configuration for a cross build/run for sh4

- source_local.sh : this file does not exist by default but can be provided to preconfigure the build/run script.

Notes:
- the source scripts are loaded by the build/run script only if they exist and in the following order:
  1. source_local.sh
  2. source_site_<site>.sh
  3. source_<arch>.sh

- the parameters are passed through the environment, the available parameters are:
  - arch=<arch> : specifies the target architecture (arm, sh4, ia32, x86_64,...). If unset, defaults to the host architecture.
  - site=<site> : specifies the site (default, stgnb,...), default if unset. Can be any name as soon as the source_site_<site>.sh is provided.
  - mode=<mode> : one of debug, release. Default is debug.
  - other typical scons vars: debuggersupport (default on), profilingsupport (default off).
